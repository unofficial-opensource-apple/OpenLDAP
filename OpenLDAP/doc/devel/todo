OpenLDAP Software To Do List
----------------------------

This is a list of projects that need getting done.  They are defined
by scale of the effort as opposed to priority.  Contribute to
projects based upon your personal priorities.

If you have a project you'd like added to the list, talk it up on
Developer's list or just do it.
